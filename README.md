# react-fiber-three experimental project

Basic app build on react-fiber-three to display a couple cubes with a few interactions

The cubes scale smothly on click thanks to react-spring
There are orbit controls to move around the scene
Some coffee texture was applied.

TODO:
- work with some terrain. Add terrain programmatically
- make a pov camera allowing controls to move around the scene
- animate objects with bones/skeletons
- add annotations: text, audio, video?
- multiuser (combine with Networked-AFrame?)
